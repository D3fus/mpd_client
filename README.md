# `mpd_client`

Prototype of a user-friendly async client for [MPD](https://musicpd.org).

This was extracted from internal code of an application, so it may not be ready for use by others yet.
Suggestions and reports of problems with the current implementation are welcome.

This code is also not yet tested in any way besides trying it and seeing if it worked.
